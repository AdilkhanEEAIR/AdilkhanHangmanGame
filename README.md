I chose the Hangman Game project. In this project, player need to guess the word by opening the letters. In this project, I used the string theme. In the project, I created a document where I added certain words. At first, I didn't know how to add, but then I studied and understood. I added using the getRandomWord method. I also used functions, while cycles and conditions. I attached screenshots and examples to GitHub.
